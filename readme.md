# Button class

One more implementation of a class to get user input from a normally open (NO) momentary push button.
I'm using this for a personal project so I can't guarantee it's production ready. Let me know if you like it or if I can improve on it.

Offers a debounced digital read function and ability to read for "click" and "double click"
